### Text-Based-Dungeons

I wrote this text based dungeon game in Java for my AP computer science class. It is under development although is almost complete. I may finish the second level and possibly will add more items, levels, or mobs. I may also add a main menu screen but I'm not entirely sure yet what will actaully happen with the future of the game. Currently you can interat with chests and your inventory/character. You can also walk around and attack mobs. You can take damage and get buffs. The map around the player is dark with a bubble of glow from items or torches.
